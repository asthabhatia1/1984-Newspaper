        Junior Species Program: Children Report Thought Criminals
The government’s Junior Species Program trains children to report thought criminals, even within their own families. Officials claim it helps protect society and ensures loyalty to the Leader.

A Boy’s Big Decision
10-year-old Liam Carter is proud to be part of the program. He learns to spot disloyalty—like whispering, reading banned books, or questioning rules.

One night, Liam sees his father reading a banned book. His teachers say such people must be reported.

Now, Liam must choose:
Report his father and be called a hero.
Stay silent and break the rules.

Is It Good or Bad?
Government officials say the program teaches responsibility. “Children secure our nation’s future,” says Minister Clarke. Over 5,000 thought criminals have been reported this year.

But critics argue it destroys trust and makes children live in fear. Human rights groups say education should teach critical thinking, not blind obedience.

What Will Liam Choose?
Liam stands at the Junior Species headquarters, decision heavy on his heart.

The story leaves Liam’s choice unknown, creating suspense: Will he choose duty—or love?
