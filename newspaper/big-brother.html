        Total Surveillance: No One is Safe
        
        Every street, every building, even your own home—nowhere is beyond the Party's watchful eye. Telescreens monitor every move, and the Thought Police punish even the faintest hint of rebellion. Independent thinking is a crime. Loyalty to Big Brother is not a choice—it is mandatory.
        
        War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength
        
        These words define our reality. Oceania is always at war to maintain peace. True freedom lies in obedience. Knowledge is dangerous; ignorance is our greatest defense.
        
        The Vanishing of Unpersons
        
        Those who disobey disappear. Their names erased, their existence denied. Asking questions is dangerous. To remember them is to risk everything.
        
        Two Minutes Hate: A Test of Loyalty
        
        Every day, citizens gather to express their fury at enemies of the state. Emmanuel Goldstein’s face appears, inciting rage. Enthusiasm is expected—hesitation is noticed.
        
        Rewriting Reality
        
        The Ministry of Truth reshapes the past to match the Party’s present. Today’s truth is tomorrow’s lie. Newspeak replaces Oldspeak, eliminating words that could foster rebellion.
        
        Obey and Survive
        
        Big Brother knows all. Trust the Party. Love Big Brother. Only through absolute loyalty can you remain safe.
        
        Remember: Thoughtcrime does not entail death. Thoughtcrime is death.
