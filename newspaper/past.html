The Ministry of Truth has reviewed and corrected the history books. They made sure the stories match what the Party says is true. This means that some things that were thought to be true are now known to be false.

New History Books Available

The updated books are now available to all citizens. Big Brother guided the Ministry of Truth to make the changes. By reading the new history books, citizens can learn the new truth and remember it correctly.

Why the Changes Were Made

The changes were made to protect the citizens of Oceania. The Ministry of Truth wants to make sure everyone has the same information and believes the same things. This will help keep our country strong and united.

What This Means for Citizens

Citizens should read the new history books and remember the new truth. We should trust Big Brother and the Party to make decisions for us. By doing so, we can help create a better future for ourselves and our children.
